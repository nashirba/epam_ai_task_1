# GenAI Vocabulary

- Model: A set of algorithms trained to perform specific tasks using data.
- Dataset: Collection of data used for training or testing a model.
- Prompt: Instruction or input for generative models to produce output.
- Bias: Unintended skew in results, often due to data issues.
- Fine-tuning: Adjusting an existing AI model with additional training for a specific purpose.
- Inference: Process of using a model to generate predictions.
- Hallucination: When AI generates content that appears real but is actually false or misleading.
- Overfitting: When a model works well on training data but poorly elsewhere.
- Context: Surrounding information needed to generate correct results.
- Latent Space: Abstract representation where generative models learn relations.
- Token: Smallest unit in data (word, sound, etc.) processed by models.
- API: Application Programming Interface for accessing AI functionalities.
- Pipeline: Complete workflow from data input to output.
- Augmentation: Technique of expanding data using synthetic or transformed samples.
- Deployment: Putting models into production for end users.
- Reinforcement Learning: Training technique using rewards for better actions.
- Scaling: Increasing resources or size for greater performance.
- Reliability: Measure of consistent and correct behavior.
- Summarization: Reducing content length while keeping key info.
